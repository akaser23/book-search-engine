# Book Search Engine

## Description
When first visiting the application, the user is able to search for books without creating any login. If the user wishes to create a login, they can sign up using the modal and once an account is created they can login using thier credentials. Once logged in, a user can save books to thier account as well as delete books. Saved books can be viewed on the saved Books page.
